# Build a dockerized Full-Stack TypeScript application
Youâ€™re free to choose your stack : 
- For the Front-End, you can choose between Angular, React or Vue.js.
- For the Back-End, you should use Node.js but you can choose between libraries.
- For the Database, you can choose between SQL or NoSQL databases. 
- For the API, you can choose between Graphql or REST.
- Your application must have a Database to save data. This Database can be hosted online or locally ( In case you have an online Database, for security reasons, create a Database only for this project and don't forget to delete it or change the credentials AFTER the interview process ).
- Your application must be dockerized

## The application is a personal library

As a user :

- I can see the list of my books. Each book has these properties : title, author, note, last modification date, ...
- I can add a new book to the list
- I can edit a book's properties

#### Add a search bar to your application to only show the searched title
#### Make your application "responsive"
#### Add more functionalities to your application

## Note :
